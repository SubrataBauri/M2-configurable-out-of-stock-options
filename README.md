# M2 Configurable product Out of stock options

### A Magento 2 extension to customise configurable product swatch option

Whenever all associated items of a configurable products are out of stock, the Item Options are not shown in Magento 2
This feature was there in Magento 1.x and is still carried on in Magento 2
But in most cases seller doesn't want that. Even though the product is out of stock we still need to show price and available options.

If your store needs that feature you can install this module.
